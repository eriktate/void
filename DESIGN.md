# Shout to the Void

## Synopsis
Shout to the Void is an experiment I thought of randomly while driving. Basically it's an (un)social media platform where you anonymously shout whatever's on your mind into the void. There's no algorithm. No following. No profiles, friends, or DMs. There's only whatever the void deems you should see...randomly.

## Getting started
Anyone can stare into the void and see the various shouts being cast in. If you want to shout yourself, you'll have to ask for a new name. Names are assigned completely randomly (generated from a giant list of adjectives, nouns, etc) and come with a secret key you'll have to hang onto. As long as you have that key, you can get back to your shouts. If you lose that key, the account is gone forever. The void will never ask for any of your personal information.

## The Void
There aren't any feeds here, just the void. And whatever the void shows you is meant for you alone. If you find something interesting in the void, you can share it with others, but they won't be able to interact with it. The only way to engage with another person's shout is if the void chooses to show it to you, and once it's gone so is your chance. However, once tangled fates can be found again and the thread continued.

## For what purpose?
This is mostly just for fun. I wanted to see a side project through from start to finish and this goofy idea seemed simple enough to knock out in a couple of weekends. I also thought it might be interesting to see how people use something like this. Social media has evolved in strange and unexpected ways over the years, especially as algorithmic discovery has become more and more pervasive. What would happen, though, if it were impossible for others to bandwagon? What if someone shared an interesting thread with you, but there was no way for you to be a part of it? What if you found a kindred spirit, but there was no way to see their other thoughts? What if you could remain truly anonymous if you chose to? Would it be possible to make a new name for yourself? Or would the cold randomness be too much of a hurdle to possibly get noticed? Only one way to find out
